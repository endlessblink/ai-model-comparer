# AI Models Comparison Site - Project Checkpoint

## Project Overview
A React-based web application for comparing different AI models and their capabilities, with a focus on Hebrew language support and a modern, responsive design.

## Current State (as of December 21, 2024)

### Implemented Features
1. **Core Layout**
   - Responsive header with navigation
   - Dark theme with gradient backgrounds
   - RTL (Right-to-Left) support for Hebrew

2. **Navigation**
   - Working router setup using React Router v6
   - Smooth transitions between pages
   - Properly configured routes for all main sections

3. **Pages**
   - Home Page (`/`)
   - Models Comparison Page (`/models`)
   - About Page (`/about`)
   - Contact Page (`/contact`)

### Technical Implementation

#### Routing Structure
```typescript
const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <Layout />,
    children: [
      {
        index: true,
        element: <Home />,
      },
      {
        path: "models",
        element: <ModelsPage />,
      },
      {
        path: "about",
        element: <AboutPage />,
      },
      {
        path: "contact",
        element: <ContactPage />,
      },
    ],
  }
], {
  future: {
    v7_startTransition: true,
    v7_relativeSplatPath: true,
    v7_fetcherPersist: true,
    v7_normalizeFormMethod: true,
    v7_partialHydration: true,
    v7_skipActionErrorRevalidation: true
  }
});
```

#### Component Structure
- `App.tsx`: Main application container with router setup
- `Layout.tsx`: Common layout wrapper with header and navigation
- `pages/`:
  - `Index.tsx`: Home page
  - `Models.tsx`: Models comparison page
  - About and Contact (inline components)

### Styling
- Using Tailwind CSS for styling
- Custom gradient backgrounds
- Consistent color scheme:
  - Background: Dark theme with gradient from `#0A0B14` to `#0d0e1a`
  - Accents: Blue (`from-blue-400`) to Purple (`to-purple-400`) gradients
  - Text: White for headings, Gray-400 for secondary text

### Next Steps
1. **Models Page Development**
   - Add comparison table/grid
   - Implement model cards with details
   - Add filtering and sorting capabilities

2. **Content Development**
   - Create content for About page
   - Set up contact form on Contact page
   - Add more detailed model information

3. **Features to Add**
   - Model comparison functionality
   - Search capabilities
   - User preferences storage
   - Detailed model information pages

### Dependencies
- React
- React Router DOM
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components

### Known Issues
- None currently - all major routing and display issues have been resolved

### Best Practices
1. **Code Organization**
   - Components in dedicated files
   - Consistent file naming
   - Clear component hierarchy

2. **Styling**
   - Consistent use of Tailwind classes
   - Reusable gradient patterns
   - Responsive design patterns

3. **Performance**
   - Lazy loading for routes
   - Optimized routing configuration
   - Future flags enabled for React Router v7 compatibility
